## Overview

The list is highly subjective and by no means complete. If you need more comprehensive list of papers, then probably [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) is much better resource.

If you'd like to contribute, then possibly don't, suggestions are welcomed, but merges aren't guaranteed. Thanks!
